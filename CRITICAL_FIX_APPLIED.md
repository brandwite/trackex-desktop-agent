# CRITICAL FIX: Services Now Require Clock-In

## Issue Resolved
**CRITICAL BUG**: Background services (app focus, heartbeat, job polling) were running and sending events even when users were not clocked in.

## Root Cause
1. **In `main.rs`**: Services started automatically on app launch if authentication token existed, without checking work session status
2. **In service loops**: Services had checks for session state but they were started unconditionally

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `main.rs` (Lines 115-121)
**Before**:
```rust
// Only checked if authenticated
if crate::storage::get_device_token().await.is_ok() {
    crate::sampling::start_all_background_services(app_handle_for_bg).await;
}
```

**After**:
```rust
// Now checks BOTH authenticated AND clocked in
if crate::sampling::is_authenticated().await && crate::sampling::is_clocked_in().await {
    log::info!("User is authenticated and clocked in, starting background services");
    crate::sampling::start_all_background_services(app_handle_for_bg).await;
} else {
    log::info!("User is not authenticated or not clocked in, services will start after clock-in");
}
```

### 2. Updated `commands.rs` - `clock_in()` (Lines 782-835)
**Added**:
```rust
// ✅ 3. Start background services now that user is clocked in
log::info!("Clock in: Starting background services");
tokio::spawn(async move {
    crate::sampling::start_all_background_services(app_handle).await;
});
```

**Effect**: Services now start automatically when user clocks in

### 3. Updated `commands.rs` - `clock_out()` (Lines 839-849)
**Added**:
```rust
log::info!("Clock out: Ending local session");
// Note: Services will automatically pause since is_clocked_in() will return false
log::info!("Clock out: Services will automatically pause on next check");
```

**Effect**: Services automatically pause on next loop iteration after clock-out

### 4. Fixed Brace Mismatch in `app_focus.rs`
- Removed extra closing brace that was causing compilation error
- Fixed indentation to match proper structure

## How It Works Now

### App Launch
1. App starts
2. Checks if user is authenticated (has valid token)
3. Checks if user is clocked in (has active work session)
4. **ONLY** if BOTH are true → Start background services
5. Otherwise → Services wait for clock-in

### Clock In
1. User clicks "Clock In"
2. Local work session created
3. Clock-in event sent to backend
4. **Background services started automatically**
5. App focus, heartbeat, idle detection, job polling all begin

### Clock Out
1. User clicks "Clock Out"
2. Local work session ended
3. Clock-out event sent to backend
4. **Services automatically pause on next loop check**
5. No explicit stop needed - graceful pause

### Service Loop Behavior
Each service checks `should_services_run()` which returns:
```rust
is_authenticated() AND is_clocked_in() AND is_services_running() AND !is_services_paused()
```

If false:
- Service pauses work
- Continues loop (doesn't exit)
- Checks again on next interval
- Automatically resumes when conditions met

## Testing

### To Verify Fix

1. **Test 1: Login without Clock-In**
   ```
   - Login to app
   - Check logs → Should see "User is not authenticated or not clocked in"
   - Check network → Should see NO app focus/heartbeat events
   - ✅ PASS if no events sent
   ```

2. **Test 2: Clock In**
   ```
   - Click "Clock In"
   - Check logs → Should see "Starting background services"
   - Wait 3 seconds (app focus interval)
   - Check network → Should see app_focus events every 3s
   - ✅ PASS if events start flowing
   ```

3. **Test 3: Clock Out**
   ```
   - Click "Clock Out"  
   - Check logs → Should see "Services will automatically pause"
   - Wait 3 seconds
   - Check network → Should see NO new events
   - ✅ PASS if events stop
   ```

4. **Test 4: App Restart While Clocked In**
   ```
   - Clock in
   - Close app
   - Reopen app
   - Check logs → Should see "authenticated and clocked in, starting"
   - Check network → Events should resume automatically
   - ✅ PASS if services auto-resume
   ```

## Expected Behavior Matrix

| User State | Auth | Clocked In | Services Running | Events Sent |
|------------|------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Just opened app | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Logged in | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Logged in + Clocked in | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Clocked out | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ⏸️ Paused | ❌ No |
| Logged out | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
1. `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Added clock-in check before starting services
2. `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` - Added service start on clock-in
3. `src-tauri/src/sampling/app_focus.rs` - Fixed brace mismatch

### Previously Modified (from earlier refactoring)
4. `src-tauri/src/sampling/mod.rs` - Added helper functions
5. `src-tauri/src/sampling/heartbeat.rs` - Added guards
6. `src-tauri/src/api/job_polling.rs` - Added guards

## Impact

### Before Fix
❌ Events sent continuously after login, even when not working
❌ Unnecessary API calls
❌ Battery drain
❌ Network usage
❌ Data sent when user not working

### After Fix
✅ Events only sent when actually working (clocked in)
✅ No unnecessary API calls
✅ Better battery life
✅ Reduced network usage  
✅ Data integrity - only work time tracked

## Rollout

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Manual test: Login without clock-in
- [ ] Manual test: Clock in
- [ ] Manual test: Clock out
- [ ] Manual test: App restart while clocked in
- [ ] Test on Windows
- [ ] Test on macOS  
- [ ] Test on Linux

### Deployment
1. Build new version
2. Test thoroughly on dev machine
3. Deploy to staging
4. Test in production-like environment
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor logs for correct behavior

## Logging Added

New log messages to verify correct behavior:

**App Launch**:
```
"User is authenticated and clocked in, starting background services"
OR
"User is not authenticated or not clocked in, services will start after clock-in"
```

**Clock In**:
```
"Clock in: Local session started with ID {session_id}"
"Clock in: Starting background services"
```

**Clock Out**:
```
"Clock out: Ending local session"
"Clock out: Services will automatically pause on next check"
```

## Next Steps

1. Restart the desktop app
2. Login but don't clock in
3. Verify no events are sent (check network tab or logs)
4. Clock in
5. Verify events start being sent
6. Clock out
7. Verify events stop
