# macOS Loading Issue - Fixed

## Problem
The app was hanging indefinitely on the "Loading TrackEx Agent..." screen on macOS, while working fine on Windows.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing HTTP Timeouts**: When checking authentication status on startup, the app made HTTP requests without timeouts. If the server was unreachable or there was no internet connection, the request would hang indefinitely.

2. **Keychain Access on macOS**: Accessing macOS keychain to retrieve stored session data could hang or take too long without proper timeout handling.

3. **Database Initialization**: Database initialization lacked timeout protection and detailed error logging.

4. **Frontend Timeout**: The frontend had no timeout mechanism, so it would wait forever for backend responses.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend HTTP Client Timeouts
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`
- Added timeouts to all HTTP clients:
  - `validate_token_with_server`: 5s timeout, 3s connect timeout
  - `login` function: 30s timeout, 10s connect timeout
- Changed error logging from `log::error` to `log::warn` for offline scenarios

### 2. Authentication Status Check
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`
- Added 2-second timeout wrapper around `get_session_data()` keychain access
- Added detailed logging at each step
- Gracefully handles timeout and keychain errors
- Falls back to unauthenticated state on any error

### 3. Consent Status Check
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`
- Added 5-second timeout for database initialization
- Added 3-second timeout for consent status retrieval
- Better error messages and logging

### 4. Database Initialization
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/storage/database.rs`
- Added detailed logging at each initialization step
- Better error handling for directory creation
- Logs database path for debugging

### 5. Keychain Access
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/storage/secure_store.rs`
- Added detailed logging for keychain operations
- Better error handling for keychain entry creation
- Logs success/failure at each step

### 6. Frontend Timeout
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- Added 15-second timeout for startup status checks
- Falls back to login screen on timeout or error
- Prevents infinite loading state

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### First Launch (No Internet)
1. App loads quickly (within 5-10 seconds)
2. Shows login screen immediately
3. Logs show timeout messages but no errors

### First Launch (With Internet)
1. App loads quickly
2. Shows login screen
3. User logs in → consent wizard → permissions setup → main app

### Subsequent Launches (Already Logged In)
1. App loads quickly
2. Validates stored session (with timeout)
3. If online and valid → shows main app
4. If offline or invalid → shows login screen

### Keychain Permission on macOS
- On first login, macOS may prompt for keychain access
- User should allow this to persist login credentials
- If denied, user will need to log in each time (but app won't hang)

## Testing Instructions for Client

1. **Test Fresh Install (No Internet)**
   ```bash
   # Disconnect from internet
   # Launch app
   # Should show login screen within 10 seconds
   ```

2. **Test Fresh Install (With Internet)**
   ```bash
   # Connect to internet
   # Launch app
   # Should show login screen quickly
   # Log in with credentials
   # Accept consent
   # Grant permissions
   # Should reach main app
   ```

3. **Test Subsequent Launch (Logged In, No Internet)**
   ```bash
   # Close app
   # Disconnect from internet
   # Launch app
   # Should show login screen (can't validate token offline)
   ```

4. **Test Subsequent Launch (Logged In, With Internet)**
   ```bash
   # Close app
   # Ensure internet connection
   # Launch app
   # Should restore session and show main app quickly
   ```

## Debug Logs

The app now logs detailed information for debugging:
- Database initialization steps
- Keychain access attempts
- HTTP request timeouts
- Session restoration attempts

To view logs on macOS:
```bash
# Run from terminal to see logs
./trackex-agent.app/Contents/MacOS/trackex-agent
```

Or check Console.app and filter for "trackex" or "TrackEx"

## Technical Details

### Timeout Strategy
- Network operations: 5-30 seconds depending on operation
- Keychain access: 2 seconds
- Database init: 5 seconds
- Frontend total: 15 seconds

These timeouts are conservative and should work even on slower connections.

### Fallback Strategy
All critical startup operations now fail gracefully:
1. Try to restore session with timeout
2. Try to validate token with timeout
3. On any failure → show login screen
4. User can always log in again

## Files Modified

1. `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` - Added timeouts to HTTP clients and authentication checks
2. `src-tauri/src/storage/database.rs` - Added logging and error handling
3. `src-tauri/src/storage/secure_store.rs` - Added logging for keychain access
4. `src/App.tsx` - Added frontend timeout and fallback handling

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for macOS
npm run tauri build

# Or for development
npm run tauri dev
```

The fix is backward compatible and won't affect Windows users.
