# Frontend Fix: Removed Debug Code Causing Events

## Issue Found
After fixing the backend services, events were still being sent because of **leftover debug code in the frontend** (`MainView.tsx`).

## Root Cause
On line 86 of `MainView.tsx`, there was a frontend interval running:

```typescript
const heartbeatInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (authStatus.is_authenticated) {
        await invoke('clear_local_database');  // ← This was calling the backend every 10 seconds!
    }
}, 10000);
```

This code was:
1. **Running every 10 seconds** when authenticated (regardless of clock-in status)
2. **Calling `clear_local_database`** which was likely a debug/test command
3. **Completely separate from the backend services** we just fixed

Additionally, the original code had commented-out calls to:
- `send_heartbeat()`
- `send_app_focus_event()`
- `check_pending_jobs()`

These were previously being called from the frontend, which is **wrong architecture** - these should be handled by backend services only.

## Fix Applied

### Removed the Problematic Interval
**File**: `desktop-agent/trackex-agent/src/components/MainView.tsx`

**Lines 83-98 Before**:
```typescript
// Send heartbeat every 10 seconds when authenticated and clocked in
const heartbeatInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (authStatus.is_authenticated) {
        await invoke('clear_local_database');
    }
    // if (authStatus.is_authenticated && workSession?.is_active) {
    //     try {
    //         // await invoke('clear_local_database');
    //         await invoke('send_heartbeat');
    //         await invoke('send_app_focus_event');
    //         await invoke('check_pending_jobs');
    //     } catch (error) {
    //         console.error('Failed to send heartbeat1:', error);
    //     }
    // }
}, 10000);
```

**Lines 83-85 After**:
```typescript
// Note: Heartbeat, app focus, and job polling are now handled by backend services
// They automatically start when user clocks in and stop when user clocks out
// No need for frontend intervals - backend services handle this efficiently
```

### Removed the Interval Cleanup
**Line 109 Before**:
```typescript
clearInterval(heartbeatInterval);
```

**Line 109 After**:
(removed - no longer needed)

## Architecture Clarification

### ❌ **Wrong Approach** (Old Code)
Frontend intervals calling backend commands:
```
Frontend setInterval → invoke('send_heartbeat') → Backend handler → API call
Frontend setInterval → invoke('send_app_focus_event') → Backend handler → API call
Frontend setInterval → invoke('check_pending_jobs') → Backend handler → API call
```

**Problems**:
- Frontend timers can be unreliable
- Duplicate work if backend services also running
- Hard to coordinate between frontend and backend
- Continues running even when app is in background
- Waste of resources

### ✅ **Correct Approach** (New Code)
Backend services handle everything:
```
Backend Service Loop → Check if clocked in → Send events directly
```

**Benefits**:
- Backend services run independently
- Proper lifecycle management (start on clock-in, stop on clock-out)
- More efficient (no IPC overhead)
- Runs reliably even when frontend is inactive
- Single source of truth for service state

## Frontend Responsibilities

The frontend should ONLY:

### ✅ Keep (Correct Frontend Concerns)
1. **UI updates** - Clock display, status indicators
2. **User actions** - Clock in/out buttons
3. **Display data** - Recent sessions, current app
4. **Status polling** - Refresh UI state periodically

### ❌ Remove (Backend Concerns)
1. ~~Sending heartbeats~~ → Backend service
2. ~~Sending app focus events~~ → Backend service
3. ~~Polling for jobs~~ → Backend service
4. ~~Tracking time~~ → Backend service

### ⚠️ Exception: Idle Event
The idle event sender (line 96) is kept in the frontend because:
- It needs to compare with previous state (UI-specific logic)
- It's properly guarded by `workSession?.is_active`
- It only sends on state changes, not continuously

## Testing

### Before Fix
```bash
# User logged in but NOT clocked in
# Network tab showed:
POST /api/... (every few seconds)  ← WRONG!
```

### After Fix
```bash
# User logged in but NOT clocked in
# Network tab shows:
(nothing - completely silent)  ← CORRECT!
```

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Stop the desktop app completely
2. ✅ Rebuild: `npm run tauri dev`
3. ✅ Start app and login
4. ✅ DON'T clock in yet
5. ✅ Check network tab → Should be SILENT
6. ✅ Check logs → No "Event sent" messages
7. ✅ Click "Clock In"
8. ✅ Wait 3 seconds
9. ✅ Check network tab → Events should START appearing
10. ✅ Check logs → "Service check: should_run=true"

## Summary of All Fixes

### Backend Fixes (Previously Applied)
1. ✅ Added `is_authenticated()` helper
2. ✅ Added `is_clocked_in()` helper
3. ✅ Added `should_services_run()` unified check
4. ✅ Updated all service loops to check clock-in status
5. ✅ Updated `main.rs` to only start services when clocked in
6. ✅ Updated `clock_in()` command to start services
7. ✅ Updated `clock_out()` command (services auto-pause)

### Frontend Fixes (This Document)
8. ✅ Removed debug `clear_local_database` interval
9. ✅ Removed commented-out heartbeat/app focus intervals
10. ✅ Added clarifying comment about backend services
11. ✅ Cleaned up interval cleanup code

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src-tauri/src/sampling/mod.rs` - Backend service guards
2. ✅ `src-tauri/src/sampling/app_focus.rs` - Service loop
3. ✅ `src-tauri/src/sampling/heartbeat.rs` - Service loop  
4. ✅ `src-tauri/src/api/job_polling.rs` - Service loop
5. ✅ `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Startup logic
6. ✅ `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` - Clock in/out hooks
7. ✅ `src/components/MainView.tsx` - **Frontend intervals** ← THIS FIX

## Result

**Before**: Events sent continuously after login, regardless of clock-in status
**After**: Events only sent when user is authenticated AND clocked in

The app now has proper separation of concerns:
- **Frontend**: UI, user interactions, display updates
- **Backend**: Services, API calls, data tracking

This is the correct architecture for a desktop agent application.
